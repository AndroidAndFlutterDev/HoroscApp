# HoroscApp: Android Expert Intermediate Project

This project prioritizes the integration of good practices, architectures, and testing into a mobile app, rather than focusing solely on a complex UI. While the UI currently utilizes XML, it serves as a valuable learning resource for essential Android development concepts.

**Key Technologies:**

* **MVVM Architecture and Clean Code:** Implement clean separation of concerns and maintainability.
* **Fragments:** Manage flexible UI components within your app.
* **Navigation Component:** Simplify and streamline in-app navigation.
* **Gradle KTS:** Utilize Kotlin for a more concise and modern build experience.
* **Dependency Injection:** Promote loose coupling and testability.
* **StateFlow and Coroutines:** Leverage powerful tools for managing data flow and asynchronous operations.
* **RecyclerView:** Efficiently display and manage large datasets.
* **Retrofit, Interceptors, and Mappers:** Make efficient network calls and handle responses effectively.
* **Intents:** Navigate between different activities or launch external apps.
* **CameraX:** Access and control the device's camera for capturing images and videos.
* **Animations:** Enhance the user experience with smooth transitions and effects.
* **Unit and UI Testing:** Ensure code quality and reliability through comprehensive testing.
